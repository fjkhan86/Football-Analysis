# SQL Database Project

**Project Initiation & Data Selection**

**Data Selection**: Begin by exploring potential datasets from a variety of sources such as CSV files (available online or in platforms like [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)), web scraping or APIs. You may also revisit the datasets you explored in week 3. **In case you need help finding a dataset, at the end of this brief, we’ve included a list of famous datasets that you could work with.** =======

Challenges Overview

We provide comprehensive football analysis on matches, players, leagues, teams and shots for the benefit of football enthusiasts, bookies and football pundits.

- **Team Performance:**
    - There is a correlation between the number of shots on target and goals scored.
    - Home teams have a higher win rate compared to away teams.
    - Teams with more yellow/red cards tend to have lower winning rates.
- **Player Performance:**
    - Forwards score more goals compared to midfielders and defenders.
    - Players with higher passing accuracy contribute to more assists.
    - The number of tackles made by a player is inversely proportional to the number of goals conceded by the team.
    - Goalkeepers with a higher number of saves per game have lower goals-against averages.
- **Match Statistics:**
    - Matches with higher total possession percentages have fewer goals.
    - The number of corners taken by a team correlates with the number of goals scored.
    - Teams that concede the first goal have a lower probability of winning the match.
    - Matches with more fouls have a higher likelihood of yellow and red cards being issued.
- **Seasonal Trends:**
    - Teams perform better in the second half of the season compared to the first half.
    - There is a significant difference in team performance before and after major tournaments (e.g., World Cup, UEFA Champions League).
    - Newly promoted teams perform worse compared to established teams in the league.

Solution

- **Data Collection**:
    - Use SQL to query customer data, including purchase history, demographics, browsing behavior, and interaction data.
    - Integrate public datasets from platforms like Kaggle to enrich the analysis and test hypotheses.
    - Files:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**:

- Clean the data using Python (e.g., pandas) to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Normalize and preprocess the data for analysis.
- **Customer Segmentation**:
    - Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) in Python to identify distinct customer segments based on behavior and demographic features.
- **Personalization Strategies**:
    - Develop personalized marketing strategies for each segment, such as targeted email campaigns, personalized product recommendations, and customized offers.

**Project Planning**: Notion AI, Trello.

**Extract**: retrieve data from various sources. Examine the data and try to understand what the fields mean before building the database.
